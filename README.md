### Haskell

Haskell is recently added! Simple ODE solvers in there (forwardEuler and backwardEuler)

# Numerical Analysis and Exploration

This repository is for my own reference and to share any Numerical exploration I do. This will be in mainly Haskell and Matlab. However, I will also use C, C++, and Python. Each language will have its own folder and readme when added.

## Matlab
This is the industry standard so I decided this would be a good to do some numerical exploration in this.
There will be differential equation solvers, integral calculators, etc.

## Haskell
I chose this language because it is purly functional and one of my goals is explore the limits and applications of functional programming while also developing my own skills in programming. 
Therefore, this was a good place to start. 
One of the draw-backs of using Haskell is how it is strictly typed and unfortunately makes exploration tiresome.

## C/C++
My two languages of choice which I use almost daily. These are good because they are part of the industry standard and a lot of my specialization. 
I prefer these two when developing new programs or brain storming

## Python
Another language I am familar with. Useful for a lot of packages when wanting to do very quick analysis.
